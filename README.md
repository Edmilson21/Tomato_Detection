# Tomato Detector üçÖ
This program is a computer vision tomato detector, this application can detect any type of tomato in real time.

# Application 
It can be implemented in the food industry or in agriculture, to separate tomatoes from other types of things. Once the tomatoes have been classified, another useful step would be to use techniques to count the number of tomatoes picked (but I will leave this for the near future).

# Difficulty
The big problem was detecting, at first I was using tensorflow, but it didn't have good performance, and I tried to use YOLO_v5, and I have good accuracy.
